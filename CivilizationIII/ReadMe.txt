Final Project for CS1331 - Java

It will say created by Tian-Yo Yang because he was I believe the TA or professor who made the skeleton code for us to work under which is essentially the logic of the game (which we had a project where we had do to it already) and our job is to implement the logic with a GUI known as javafx.

A primitive game of Civilization that again even has a GUI. Again this is not all the code needed to run it.

Uses logic to advance different screen elements and updates in real time. Has main menu and selection screens.
