MazeRunner on Mbed for ECE 2035

Embedded system final project that I uncluded the top I suppose for legal reason though I had rewritten everything that entirety of the code is mine.

It links levels using doubly linked list with interrupts and animations. Even though there are level switching things scores are remembered until player loses.

Many other extra levels take collisions to extreme and performance must then be taken into account given the limited mbed microcontroller.
