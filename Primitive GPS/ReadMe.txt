This is my final project for ECE 4122. It is a Primitive prototype GPS. 
So far it uses only a premade made map because of the amount of time we had.

This are not all the files needed to run it, just enough to demonstrate how it runs.

findpath.cpp plays the main function of finding where finding destinations and sources and 
tries to find the shortest path. I wrote about half of this code.

I did the entirety of the GUI because my teammates were not keen on it until I had something workable.
I used QT and it is generally straight forward though I had to make it work under the circumstances
that my professor required.
