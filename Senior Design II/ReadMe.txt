Work in Progress of Senior Design Project

Currently uses mbed C++ but will move to arduino C.
Currently takes motion of users within a period of time and creates a waveform for all 3 dimensions.

Uses algorithm to decide what is the intended input and compares by transforming the waveform with FFTs.

Uses IR components, SD storage and others devices which are also being worked on though this file performs the main functions.
